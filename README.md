# A Dashboard Comparing Energy Efficiency and CO2 Emissions Across UK Regions

---


## Overview

This repository contains the Power BI project file and analysis for the **UK Residential Energy Performance Dashboard**.

The project analyzes energy efficiency scores and estimated CO2 emissions from 2013-2023. The data is broken down across 11 UK regions and segmented by residential property type and tenure.

## Key Findings

Based on the dashboard analysis, the top-level metrics are:

* **Average Energy Efficiency Score: 66**
* **Average CO2 Emissions:** 3.14 tonnes/year
* **Regions Analyzed:** 11

## Dashboard Visuals

The main dashboard consists of two primary charts:

1.  **Regional Comparison**
    This chart shows the **Energy Efficiency Score** for each region as a stacked bar, broken down by property type (Detached, Semi-detached, Terraced, Flats). Overlaid are line graphs showing the **Estimated CO2 Emissions** for each tenure type (Owner-occupied, Private rent, Social rent).

2.  **Efficiency Over Time**
    Titled "Energy Efficiency of Housing by Property Type in 5-Year Periods from 2013 to 2023" , this chart tracks the change in energy efficiency scores for each of the four main property types.
